<h1>Mikasa My First <3 </h1>

<p>It all started in the summer of 2018 ,after freshly passing out of our 10 th grade .We were free like never before at that time I was introduced to anime by a fellow OTAKU friend . I got addicted to anime one by one binge watching it like a ferocious beast feeding on it's prey. Time passed by completing famous anime one after another deathnote,codegeass,one outs,tokyo ghoul then came AOT .Never thought that a anime like this would impress me so much though I was interested in the story, but the anime had me in for more right from the beginning , the factors it had that made it farly superior and one of the most popular anime of recent years was cinematography,writing,action,direction,anime style,and the character arc they build upon certain characters .It was phenomenal a piece of art. Mikasa is one of the character of this series as a pov of her personality I liked her a lot compared to other anime .The most respect I have is for Comman. Erwin Smith apart from that Levi. This Anime is a must recommended by me because if you miss watching this , then you are certainly missing one of the finest creation of Arts in this world.  "Shinzo wo Sassageyo" </p>
